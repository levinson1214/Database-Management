Correct output for some queries
Mostly correct queries
Mostly correct SQL statements
SQL statements are somewhat readable

Recommendations: 
 To improve your readability, write queries like this:
  SELECT DISTINCT pid
  FROM orders
  WHERE aid IN (SELECT aid
                FROM orders
                WHERE cid IN (SELECT cid
                              FROM customers
                              WHERE city = 'Dallas'))
  ORDER BY pid DESC;     -- < notice the correct indentation here


1. Show the cities of agents booking an order for a customer whose id is 
   'c002'. Use joins; no subqueries.

Incorrect output
- You are joining by the wrong fields.


2. Show the ids of products ordered through any agent who makes at least 
   one order for a customer in Dallas, sorted by pid from highest to 
   lowest. Use joins; no subqueries.

Incorrect output
- You are joining by the wrong fields.


4. Show the names of customers who have never placed an order. Use an 
   outer join.

Incorrect output
- do you remember what  = null does?


In general: 

- Please do not use tabs for indentation. Use spaces instead.

- Test all your SQL statements.

- Make sure you read all the instructions for queries really well.

- Make sure your name is somewhere in the .sql file.
