Evidence looks ok.

Good organization of screenshots.

The definition of a Superkey needs work. It currently says: "A superkey is a
set of attributes in which the values of the attributes identify only one
entity in the set of entities." I believe, instead of "entities" here you
should talk about "rows" or "tuples" that are uniquely identified by a
superkey.

You might have the wrong concept of what -nullable- means. Or also you may not
understand how to work with dates in SQL. It is a poor example.

The ``frist normal form'' has nothing to do with primary keys. Please check
your notes and the textbook Chapter 6.1.

You have a typo. It should be the ``access rows by content only'' rule; and it
needs more work. Please check your notes or the book Chapter 6.1.
