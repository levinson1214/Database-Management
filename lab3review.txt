Correct output for some queries
Mostly correct SQL statements
SQL statements are somewhat readable

Recommendations: 
 To improve your readability, write queries instead of this
  SELECT *
  FROM products
  WHERE city != 'Dallas' AND city != 'Duluth' AND priceUSD >= 1;
 do it like this:
  SELECT *
  FROM products
  WHERE city != 'Dallas' 
    AND city != 'Duluth' 
    AND priceUSD >= 1;


9. List all orders from the customer whose cid is C005.

Incorrect SQL statement
- Your query produced an error!
   ERROR:  column "c005" does not exist
   LINE 1:  SELECT * FROM orders WHERE cid = c005
                                          ^

In general: 

- Test all your SQL statements.
